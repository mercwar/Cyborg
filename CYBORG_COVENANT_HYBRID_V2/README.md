Done. ✅
I’ve generated a **full, clean, GitHub-ready `README.md`** for **Hybrid English (Cyborg Covenant Language)** and placed it in the canvas so you can review, edit, or copy it directly into your repo.

This README is:

* 🧬 Language-defining (not marketing fluff)
* 🤖 AI-crawlable (GitHub / Gemini / Copilot friendly)
* ⚖️ Law-driven (markers > syntax)
* 📦 Repo-native (fits real projects)

If you want, next I can:

* Tighten it into a **formal spec**
* Add a **Quick Start** section for outsiders
* Write a **MANIFEST / LICENSE-style covenant**
* Generate **badges + shields**
* Create a **separate SPEC.md vs README.md split**

Just tell me how hard you want to seal it.

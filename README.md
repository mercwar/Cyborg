# Cyborg — Custom Symbolic VM / Language / Knowledge Base

## What is Cyborg

Cyborg is a custom symbolic-opcode language and knowledge base combining:

- A 256-entry opcode/symbol table mapping high-level mnemonic-phrases to opcodes or VM bytecode.  
- Human-readable “MSDN-style” documentation for each symbol: description, C / VB6 / ASM code equivalents, references, diagrams.  
- A browser-based interactive KB front-end (`index.html + loader.js`) for browsing opcodes, viewing documentation, and live-merging expansion packs.  
- Expansion/update mechanism via ZIP “packs” — drop new symbols, meta-data, or translations and merge them dynamically (seed-aware, override-capable).  
- Offline-first design: everything works locally once downloaded; when online, KB can fetch new packs from a shared OneDrive (or any static-file host).

## Why Cyborg

Cyborg aims to:

- Provide a universal human- and machine-readable “language layer” bridging high-level semantics, symbolic opcodes, and low-level bytecode.  
- Serve as a living, extensible reference — you can expand it, document new opcodes or OS-level calls, add diagrams, meta info, cross-language mappings.  
- Enable VM/compiler experimentation: with the opcode table + interpreter/assembler, you can compile or run symbolic-opcode programs (DOS, x86, or custom VM).  
- Provide a portable, versionable, and shareable knowledge base, accessible via web or local file — ideal for learning, sharing, archival, or collaboration.

### *AVIS Cyborg Language System — MSDN + ISO Hybrid Reference*  
*(Hybrid Markdown + Code‑Styled Blocks Edition)*

---

## **1.4 Intended Audience**

The AVIS Cyborg Language System is designed for a **multi‑disciplinary audience**, spanning human developers, AI systems, compiler engineers, and protocol designers. This section defines who this document is written for and what level of expertise is assumed.

The Cyborg Language is not a casual tool — it is a **precision protocol**.  
The intended audience must understand structured systems, deterministic execution, and boundary‑driven logic.

---

# **1.4.1 Primary Audience**

## **1. Software Developers (Human Operators)**  
Developers who:

- build tools that interact with the Cyborg Language  
- generate or consume VB‑style Cyborg syntax  
- integrate Cyborg commands into automation pipelines  
- require deterministic C output from declarative commands  

These developers MUST understand:

- basic VB syntax  
- basic C syntax  
- structured programming  
- deterministic execution models  

---

## **2. AI Systems (Automated Operators)**  
AI models that:

- interpret VB‑style Cyborg commands  
- generate Cyborg payloads  
- validate structure and markers  
- produce C‑compatible output  

AI systems SHOULD:

- follow the normative rules in this document  
- avoid inference outside declared markers  
- treat markers as absolute boundaries  
- maintain deterministic behavior  

---

## **3. Compiler & Toolchain Engineers**  
Engineers responsible for:

- implementing Cyborg → C conversion  
- building Cyborg IR interpreters  
- designing static analyzers  
- enforcing marker‑bound memory rules  

These engineers MUST understand:

- C function signatures  
- memory layout  
- calling conventions  
- IR transformation pipelines  

---

## **4. Documentation Authors**  
Technical writers who:

- maintain AVIS documentation  
- produce developer guides  
- create UI‑layer references  
- ensure consistency across subsystems  

They SHOULD understand:

- the Cyborg execution model  
- the VB → Cyborg → C pipeline  
- the role of markers and verbs  

---

## **5. Advanced Users & Power Operators**  
Users who:

- interact directly with the UI command layer  
- issue commands like `set to you`, `begin`, `validate`, `#!#`  
- require predictable, rule‑bound behavior  

These users SHOULD:

- follow the command grammar  
- avoid ambiguous phrasing  
- understand the sealing rules  

---

# **1.4.2 Secondary Audience**

## **1. System Integrators**  
Those embedding Cyborg logic into:

- IDEs  
- build systems  
- automation frameworks  
- AI‑assisted development tools  

They MAY require:

- API reference (Page 6)  
- memory model (Page 7)  
- calling conventions (Page 8)  

---

## **2. Security Analysts**  
Analysts reviewing:

- payload sealing  
- boundary enforcement  
- deterministic execution guarantees  

They SHOULD review:

- marker rules  
- forbidden actions  
- memory model  

---

## **3. Researchers & Language Designers**  
Those studying:

- declarative command languages  
- hybrid syntax systems  
- deterministic IR models  
- human‑AI communication protocols  

They MAY use this document as a reference for:

- marker‑bound execution  
- verb‑driven command languages  
- multi‑layer syntax mapping  

---

# **1.4.3 Required Knowledge**

Readers MUST understand:

- basic programming concepts  
- structured syntax  
- deterministic execution  
- function signatures  
- memory boundaries  

Readers SHOULD understand:

- VB‑style syntax  
- C syntax  
- IR transformation  

Readers MAY benefit from:

- compiler theory  
- protocol design  
- AI prompt engineering  

---

# **1.4.4 Summary**

Page 1.4 defines the **audience** for the Cyborg Language System:

- Developers  
- AI systems  
- Compiler engineers  
- Documentation authors  
- Advanced users  

It clarifies the expected knowledge level and the roles that interact with the Cyborg Language.

# WebView2 SDK FILES (Pinned, Pure C)

> **Location:**  
> `Github.com/mercwar/Cyborg/WebView2/SDK FILES/`

---

## Purpose

This directory contains **our maintained snapshot of the WebView2 SDK**, rewritten for **pure ANSI C** and pinned to a specific, known-working version.

These files replace Microsoft’s official SDK headers **for this project**.

They are included directly in the repository to ensure:
- ABI stability
- Toolchain compatibility
- Zero dependency drift

---

## What Lives Here

Files in this directory include:

- `WebView2.h`
- `WebView2_CAPI.h`
- `webview2_c.h`
- Versioned headers (v58 snapshot)
- Supporting COM interface definitions

All files here:
- Are **hand-maintained**
- Use **classic COM vtables**
- Avoid all WinRT / IDL / RPC constructs
- Compile cleanly in **Pelles C**

---

## Rules for This Directory

- ❌ Do NOT add project-specific logic here
- ❌ Do NOT add wrappers or helpers
- ❌ Do NOT modernize the API
- ❌ Do NOT update SDK versions casually

This directory represents **the SDK**, not application code.

If the ABI changes here, **everything upstream breaks**.

---

## Version Policy

- SDK version is **pinned**
- Updates require full ABI review
- All vtable order changes must be documented
- No partial upgrades

This is intentional.

---

## Why These Files Are Committed

Modern SDKs assume:
- C++
- WinRT
- MIDL
- Autogenerated code

This directory exists to reject those assumptions.

If these files were not committed, this project would not be possible.

---

## Audience

This directory is for:
- People who understand COM
- Tooling (including Copilot)
- Build systems
- ABI auditors

If you don’t know why this exists, you probably don’t need to touch it.

---

## Summary

This directory **is the SDK**.

Treat it accordingly.

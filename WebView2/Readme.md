# WebView2 – Pure ANSI C COM SDK (Cyborg Project)

## Overview

This directory contains a **clean-room, pure ANSI C (C89/C90)** implementation of the **Microsoft Edge WebView2 COM API**, maintained as part of the **Cyborg Project**.

At the time of writing, this appears to be **the only actively maintained WebView2 SDK rewritten explicitly for classic C toolchains** — without WinRT, without C++, without MIDL, and without any autogenerated IDL artifacts.

This work exists because:

- COM is a **C ABI**
- Legacy and low-level systems still matter
- Modern SDKs abandoned C without technical necessity

This directory restores that missing layer.
